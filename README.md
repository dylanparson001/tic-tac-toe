# tic-tac-toe
Tic Tac Toe game made with Javascript, utilizing factory functions and the module pattern for creating objects

The purpose of this project is to learn and use different styles of object creation, main goal being for everything to be contained
in its own scope as opposed to globally scoped variables and logic. This method is moduler by nature and provides for some flexibility
for adding and changing functionality.
